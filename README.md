# SEMI-ACTIVE-POWER-TRAINS-SYSTEM-FOR-HYBRID-VEHICLES
SEMI ACTIVE POWER TRAINS SYSTEM FOR HYBRID VEHICLES ESTIMATED
I designed and developed a semi-active power train system for hybrid vehicles. This project involved creating a power management system that optimizes the use of both electric and internal combustion engine power sources to improve efficiency and performance. The semi-active system dynamically adjusts the power distribution based on driving conditions and battery status.

Project Overview:

System Design:

Developed a control strategy to manage the power flow between the electric motor and the internal combustion engine.
Implemented algorithms to switch between power sources and combine their outputs for optimal performance.
Component Integration:

Integrated electric motors, batteries, and combustion engines with control electronics.
Designed and programmed a microcontroller to manage the power distribution and control signals.
Simulation and Testing:

Used simulation tools to model the power train system and predict performance under various driving conditions.
Conducted real-world testing to validate the system's efficiency and responsiveness.
Energy Management:

Implemented regenerative braking to recover energy and recharge the battery.
Developed strategies for optimizing battery usage and prolonging battery life.
Skills Gained:
